<h1>Contact Models and Multibody Dynamics</h1>

<h2>Contact Models</h2>

<p>
    Solving contact dynamics is NP-hard problem<a href="#[1]">[1]</a> due to its non-convexity and discontinuity.
    To make the problem tractable, physics engines approximate the contact problem as a relaxed problem that enables using efficient solving methods.
</p>

<p>
    One common method is polytope approximation that relaxes Coulomb's friction cone constraint as pyramid shape. This approximation transforms Non-linear Complementarity Problem (NCP) to Linear Complementarity Problem, which has the efficient solving methods such as Lemke<a href="#[2]">[2]</a>, Dantzig<a href="#[3]">[3]</a> and Projected Gauss-Seidel.
    This approach is mathematically clear but sacrifices reality of simulation significantly, especially when the simulation has many slipping contacts.
</p>

<p>
    ODE and DART apply this approach for contact simulation. They provide LCP Dantzig and LCP Projected Gauss-Seidel (PGS) solver that can be selected by a user.
    While Dantzig solver finds an exact solution of LCP, PGS solver finds an approximated solution iteratively. Note that DART's Dantzig solver is cloned from ODE Dantzig solver.
</p>

<p>
    Bullet approximates the problem into Mixed Linear Complementary Problem and uses Sequential Impulse solver to find the solution that also approximates the friction cone into polytope.
    However it post-processes the solution to satisfy round shape friction cone constraint.<a href="#[4]">[4]</a>
</p>

<p>
    RaiSim uses the Bisection method<a href="#[5]">[5]</a> that iteratively finds impulse solution which satisfies both Coulomb's friction cone constraint and zero normal velocity constraint.
    It uses a geometrical interpretation of the NCP problem to find the feasible solution in a remarkably efficient manner.
</p>

<p>
    While the above engines hold strict complementarity in velocity level, MuJoCo is based on the complementarity-free method that approximately enforces the complementarity condition.<a href="#[6]">[6]</a>
    It relaxes complementary constraint and makes the hard contact problem into convex. With this relaxation, the penetration between object happens, but the solution can be obtained efficiently.
</p>

<h2>Multibody Dynamics</h2>

<p>
    Solving dynamics of a robotic articulated system with $n$ links has $O(n^3)$ complexity which is very expensive.
    Most state-of-the-art physics engines, thus, adopted the Featherstone algorithm that solves the dynamics for open kinematic chain structure in $O(n)$ complexity.<a href="#[7]">[7]</a>
    It uses minimal (or reduced) coordinate formulation that represents $n$ link robot's configuration with $n$ or $n+6$ variables for fixed based and floating based robot respectively.
</p>

<p>
    RaiSim, Bullet, MuJoCo and DART uses minimal coordinate representation and the Featherstone algorithm for the multibody dynamics. ODE does not use minimal coordinate, instead use the maximal coordinate representation with $6n$ variables.
